//! Chargebacks (issue #90). A sale is a destination charge with no `on_behalf_of`
//! (https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges), so MakerFoundry is the merchant of record
//! and Stripe takes a disputed payment, and its dispute fee, from MakerFoundry's balance
//! (https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work). The seller's transfer isn't touched by
//! Stripe, so MakerFoundry takes it back itself, as on a refund (Seller Terms § 7):
//!
//! - `charge.dispute.created`: the order is `disputed`, so the buyer can't download it; the
//!   disputed price is taken back from the seller's transfer (a transfer reversal), then
//!   MakerFoundry's 10% of it goes back to the seller (a partial refund of the application fee), so
//!   the seller is out the card fee only; the seller is emailed.
//! - `charge.dispute.closed`, `won` (or an inquiry closed, `warning_closed`): the order is paid
//!   again and what was taken from the seller is transferred back (less the 10% they had back);
//!   `lost`: the order is a `chargeback`, still blocked. The seller is emailed either way.
//!
//! The event is recorded in the webhook's transaction (once, by its id); the Stripe calls come
//! after it (`settle`), and again from the sweep until each is done. Every call is checked with
//! Stripe first (the reversals on the transfer, the refunds of the application fee, the transfers
//! in the order's transfer group) and sent with an idempotency key, so none is ever made twice,
//! and runs under a per-order lock, so the webhook and the sweep never race. A step Stripe refuses
//! (the seller's balance too low, say) is logged and the admins are alerted; the webhook still
//! answers Stripe, and `/admin/orders` shows the dispute until it's settled.
//!
//! Orders from shops (MF-83) are disputed the same way at Stripe, but their money moves differently
//! (`shop_orders::after`): a dispute on one is logged and the admins alerted, to settle by hand.
